#  Mandelbrot Render

A command line tool to render the Mandelbrot Set, as well as its variations. This started as a school project and grew into a small piece of python code, and finally into this Swift program. It includes several helpful features such as:

-A user-friendly (though incomplete) class for dealing with complex numbers that includes operations and is easily extensible
-Ability to export to Windows `.bmp` files (for speed) and universally accepted `.png` images (for size)
-Easily configurable settings to change image size, iterations of the fractal, etc.
-Progress indicators for rendering and data conversion

I hope you find this project useful and fun!
